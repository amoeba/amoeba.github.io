From [Complexity Has to Live Somewhere](https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html):

> _Complexity has to live somewhere._ If you embrace it, give it the place it deserves, design your system and organisation knowing it exists, and focus on adapting, it might just become a strength.

Great take on managing complexity.
Instantly reminds me of Rich Hickey's excellent talk, [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/) where he discusses simplicity and complexity in software and how complexity does not necessarily mean something is complicated (to understand). Rich's talk has stuck with me and I imagine this post will too. The entire post (and Rich's talk) are well worth a read/listen.
