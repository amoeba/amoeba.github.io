      <description>I recently needed to convert a shapefile to a raster for use in another package and wanted to share my steps here.
For this demonstration, I started with the Natural Earth Data 1:10m Physical Vectors Land shapefile and will convert it to a raster using the raster package.
A bit of searching around on the web led me to Amy Whitehead’s page on Converting shapefiles to rasters in R. The code listed there wasn’t quite what I needed but gave me the head start on figuring out what I needed to do.</description>

      <description>NetCDF is an open file format commonly used to store oceanographic (and other) data such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), and much more. I recently needed to work with SST data from the NCEP Reanalysis and found that I didn’t know how to work with NetCDF files. This post should serve as a short introduction working with NetCDF files using the R package ncdf.
Step 1: Acquire the NetCDF library Before we can open a NetCDF file in R, we need to install the NetCDF library on our system.</description>
