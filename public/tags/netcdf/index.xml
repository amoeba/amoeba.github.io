      <description>NetCDF is an open file format commonly used to store oceanographic (and other) data such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), and much more. I recently needed to work with SST data from the NCEP Reanalysis and found that I didnâ€™t know how to work with NetCDF files. This post should serve as a short introduction working with NetCDF files using the R package ncdf.
Step 1: Acquire the NetCDF library Before we can open a NetCDF file in R, we need to install the NetCDF library on our system.</description>
