      <description>I wanted to be able to share R code for various tasks in a blog-like format. Jekyll is a popular blogging tool based upon the idea of using Markdown to write and Jekyll to publish the content as HTML.
This was intriguing to me but I didnâ€™t want to just write in Markdown, I wanted to post R code as well. A fantastic solution for merging the two is knitr, which allows the author to alternate between prose and R code seamlessly, including the result of the R code in-line.</description>
