Hi, I'm Bryce.
I work on linked open data, semantics, ontologies, science metadata, reproducible research and all kinds of other stuff at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). Sometimes I also [teach](/teaching) and give [talks](/talks).

In my free time, I work on [TreeStats](http://treestats.net) and other stuff related to Asheron's Call. You can see other stuff I've worked on on my [projects](/projects) page and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amoeba) profile. I used to work in fisheries prior to software and still do [some research](http://www.aoos.org/2018-run-timing-outlook-and-forecast-summary-chinook-salmon-yukon-river-delta/) every year.
