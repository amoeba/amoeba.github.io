Hi, I'm Bryce.

I work on linked open data, semantics, ontologies, science metadata, reproducible research, and all kinds of other stuff at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). I also really enjoy [teaching](/teaching) and giving [talks](/talks).

In my free time, I work on [TreeStats](http://treestats.net) and other stuff related to [Asheron's Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheron%27s_Call). You can see other stuff I've worked on on my [projects](/projects) page and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amoeba) profile. I used to work in fisheries prior to software and [still do](http://www.aoos.org/2019-run-timing-outlook-and-forecast-summary-chinook-salmon-yukon-river-delta/)!

I tweet at [@brycem](https://twitter.com/brycem) and post pictures of my dog on Instagram at [@brycemecum](https://www.instagram.com/brycemecum/) if you're into that sort of thing.
