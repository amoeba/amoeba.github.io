I'm a Scientific Software Engineer at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://nceas.ucsb.edu) working remotely from Juneau, Alaska, USA. Before that, I earned an M.S. in Fisheries from the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/). I'm broadly interested in computational topics in the (biological) sciences, especially statistical modeling and data visualization.
